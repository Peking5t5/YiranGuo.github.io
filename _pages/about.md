Hey there! I’m Yiran Guo, a grad student who’s probably spent too much time chasing ideas down rabbit holes. I work on artificial intelligence, computer vision and multi-sensor navigation. And I’m fascinated by something newly released. Stick around if you’re into weird questions, random discoveries, or just want to see if I ever figure this stuff out!
